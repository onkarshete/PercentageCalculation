/*
    --> This is my first Repository and small project on Github.com with
    -->This is percentage calculation software.
    --> I've make this simply software in C++ (Object Oriented Programming)
    --> This software will Calculate total and percentage of the subjects.
    --> How got this idea? My brother has recently done his 10th Board Exam.
         suddenly I got an simple idea , how the board employee(software engineer's )
         has calculated this mark in best of 5 system.
         Fun to hear that... they are going to calculated individual student..!
    --> Then suddenly I came to realize that how they are filter the marks...!
    --> Then that idea gonna towards little software.
    --> This is not a big software but It's going to little part of Repository of github.com
    --> This simply software has use for gathering the total marks and percentage of subjects..!
